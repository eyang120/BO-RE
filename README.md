# Introduction 
A major concern at the Bogalusa mill is reduction efficiency. Even a tiny increase in efficiency can
mean thousands of dollars saved for the mill. This project aimed to create an interface 
through which a mill operator could theoretically run models and create predictions. 

# Getting Started

If someone is already hosting the file on the same network, no dependencies are needed.
However, to host the file, Python is required, as well as the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- streamlit
- sklearn
- plotly
- pytorch
- xgboost

To install these, go to where the repository is located, open a terminal
and type the following:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Build and Test
To begin hosting, go to the location of the repository, access the terminal, and run the following command.
```python -m streamlit run testgui.py```

# Contribute
Please report any bugs.
