# Introduction 
A major concern at the Bogalusa mill is reduction efficiency. Even a tiny increase in efficiency can
mean thousands of dollars saved for the mill. This project aimed to create an interface 
through which a mill operator could theoretically run models and create predictions. 

# Getting Started

If someone is already hosting the file on the same network, no dependencies are needed.
However, to host the file, Python is required, as well as the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- streamlit
- sklearn
- plotly
- pytorch
- xgboost

Information on how to install these are in the [setup file](SETUP.md)

# Build and Test
To begin hosting, go to the location of the repository, access the terminal, and run the following command.  
You must have Python installed for this to work!
```python -m streamlit run testgui.py```
